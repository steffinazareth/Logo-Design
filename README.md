Hello! My name is Steffi Nazareth (she/her/hers) and I’m currently a Master’s student from the Information Systems Management program at Heinz College (CMU).

Durga is one of the idols widely worshiped in India. Her multiple hands hold weapons to defeat evil. I wanted to take reference from that, throw some light on my home country and show everyone the four things that help me overcome/defeat sadness – cheesecake, sleep, music and comic books.

Another thing the image represents is that I’m an introvert, living in my own little bubble; content and trying my best to perfectly balance both work/studies and life.

Remembering the days when I did have some time to spare, you would find me either binge-watching tv shows (this still persists over the weekends), saving easy-to-follow baking recipes, reading manga or making paper-cut illustrations.

Currently, I’m on the path to learn more about the field of product management. I hope, by the end of the course, that I’ll be able to know more about the principles of UI and the design experience to make user-friendly products in the future.
